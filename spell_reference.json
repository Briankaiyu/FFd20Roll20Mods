The second diverts the course of the targeted river.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlter Current: The river's current increases or decreases in speed by up to 1 mile per hour per 2 caster levels you possess. A typical placid river travels at a rate of up to 2 mph (no effect on local movement); a swift river travels 2-4 mph, moving creatures and objects 10 to 40 feet downstream per round; and an area of river rapids travels 7-10 mph, moving creatures and objects 60 to 90 feet downstream per round. Altering the speed of the current alters the difficulty of swimming in the water accordingly.\\nDivert River: The river diverts its course in a direction of your choosing. The river flows in the general direction indicated, but otherwise conforms to the shape of the local terrain. This spell cannot cause a river to flow uphill, though the river surges over its natural banks and inundates terrain lower than its average depth. Creatures in the path of the redirected river are in danger of being swept away; if directed properly, this spell causes a flood. See Aquatic Terrain for more details."

A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.\\n\\n\\nRegardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released.\\n\\n\\n\\nSkeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. Note: The bloody skeleton and burning skeleton variants are created by use of the animate dead spell but count as double their normal HD when doing so.\\nZombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a physical anatomy. Note: The rule regarding costing double HD for creating variant bloody skeleton and burning skeleton variants was not included in the fast zombie and plague zombie variant zombie template details. It is left to the GMs discretion if that rule would apply to creating variant zombies."

The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised).\\n\\n\\nYou can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot raise someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised."

If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gil in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession.\\n\\n\\nRedemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.\\n\\n\\nThough the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.\\n\\n\\nNote: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player.

For example, if you and your allies are beating a member of the city guard for information, creatures within the area don't think this is unusual or cause for alarm; if your ally is aiming a crossbow at the queen from a balcony, the affected creatures accept this as normal and unworthy of concern. Any hostile actions by you or your allies against a creature or its allies break the effect of the spell for that creature. When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions from the earlier events remain. Each mention of the events as noteworthy (such as being questioned about them by an authority figure) allows the target another Will save to break the effect and remember things normally."

On a successful attack, a living target is engulfed in chill black flames that feed on the fuel of their victim's life force. A creature engulfed in blackfire must make a successful Fortitude save each round that the spell is in effect or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated. A creature that makes its Fortitude save takes no damage for that round and is sickened instead. In addition to its effects on the subject, blackfire can spread rapidly. Each round on its turn, any living creature adjacent to a creature engulfed in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex save or become engulfed itself. Any creature that has its Constitution reduced to 0 or lower by the spell is turned into a pile of black ash and can be returned to life only by full-life, the caster of which must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check to restore the victim to life. If a creature succeeds on its Fortitude save in 3 consecutive rounds, the blackfire affecting it gutters out. The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but a successful dispel snuffs it out."

A coup de'grace still forces you to make a Fortitude save or die.\\n\\n\\nYou can cast this spell quickly enough to avoid complete destruction if you are unexpectedly affected by a lethal melee or ranged attack or effect. You cannot cast this spell if you are unconscious.\\n\\n\\nYou remain in a state of delayed fatality until some third party provides you with magical healing in the amount equal to 10 points + the amount of damage your body originally (and subsequently) sustained which dropped you into this deferred state. When so cured, you become conscious, possess 1 hp, 1 MP, and sustain 1d4+1 points of temporary ability damage on each of your six ability scores. (If this brings your Constitution score to 0, you die normally.)"

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel. Dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel can take effect.\\n\\n\\nYou choose to use dispel in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\\n\\n\\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\\n\\n\\nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\\n\\n\\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\\n\\n\\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\\n\\n\\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\\n\\n\\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\\n\\n\\nCounterspell: When dispel is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell."

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \\\"Come here,\\\" \\\"Go there,\\\" \\\"Fight,\\\" and \\\"Stand still.\\\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.\\n\\n\\nOnce you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).\\n\\n\\nChanging your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.\\n\\n\\nBy concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.\\n\\n\\nSubjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.\\n\\n\\nIf you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.\\n\\n\\nMultiple Mental Control Effects: Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant, such as spells that remove the subject's ability to act. Mental controls that don't remove the recipient's ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys."

When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.\\n\\n\\nOn Target: You travel to the correct creature's current dreamscape.\\n\\n\\nOff Target: You travel to an area near the target dreamscape on the Ethereal Plane.\\n\\n\\nOther Dreamscape: You travel to a similar creature's dreamscape on the Dimension of Dreams.\\n\\n\\nMishap: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time \\\"Mishap\\\" comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.\\n\\n\\nRegardless of the accuracy of your dream travel, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can't use dream travel, nor can creatures that can't dream.\\n\\n\\nYou might be able to exit the dream near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.\\n\\n\\nYou can use dream travel to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the dream travel and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using dream travel to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply."

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more.

A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earth rupture affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earth rupture spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.\\n\\n\\nCave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.\\n\\n\\nCliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\\n\\n\\nOpen Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).\\n\\n\\nStructure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\\n\\n\\nRiver, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.\\n\\n\\nPinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead."

A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the status effect.\\n\\n\\nIf the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.\\n\\n\\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action."

If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it takes 3d6 points of water damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful Saving Throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement.\\n\\n\\nIn addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of water damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them. You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height geyser spell."

While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target's skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target's skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.\\n\\n\\nIf the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending green caress.\\n\\n\\nThe target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn't occur and the spell ends.

For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries. You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly historic happenings."

Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created, though it can mold its edges to form a snug fit against any terrain it is cast on or adjacent to. Any creature adjacent to the iceburg when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt an iceburg and it deals full damage to it (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting an iceburg creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 1 hour.\\n\\n\\nThe iceburg is 20 feet thick. It covers up to a 100-foot-square area per caster level (so a 20th-level geomancer can create a wall of ice 2,000 feet long and 100 feet high, a wall 1,000 feet long and 200 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 200,000 square feet). The entire area of the spell must be within the caster's line of sight, which frequently limits the practical maximum size of the spell. The plane must be oriented to be straight up and down, it is not possible to use iceburg to create a ramp or tilted slope, or to lay it flat along the ground. An iceburg must either be anchored on the floor or be anchored on two opposite sides.\\n\\n\\nEach 100-foot square of wall has 300 hit points. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 5d6 points of ice damage + 1 point per caster level (no save)."

Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight.

Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can't attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level.\\n\\n\\nEach scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location's layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building's layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear."

In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can't repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone's emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.\\n\\n\\nEach insects' size is Fine.

The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it.

Alternatively, you can make the creature register as non-magical, hiding all spell effects that he is currently affected by from such scrutiny. If you choose to make the creature register as being the subject of one or more spells, you can also alter the unique spellcasting identifiers of those spell auras, in the same fashion as described for objects."

You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.\\n\\n\\nWhile in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)\\n\\n\\nYou could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.\\n\\n\\nAttempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.\\n\\n\\nIf you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.\\n\\n\\nAs a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.\\n\\n\\nIf the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.\\n\\n\\nIf the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location."

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.\\n\\n\\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.\\n\\n\\nThe range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level illusionist can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.\\n\\n\\nAny time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.\\n\\n\\nThe following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying.\\n\\n\\nStone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.\\nStone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you.\\nTransmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.\\nFinally, passwall expels you without damage."

In a desert, you must succeed at a DC 25 caster level check to actually create the spring, and its output is 1 gallon of drinking water per caster level each day.\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, in dry areas, erosion may cause the flow of water to be blocked if the affected area is left untended before a sufficient amount of vegetation has grown around it to keep the soil in place. In an arctic environment, low temperatures may cause the water to freeze. In a tropical environment, parasites may contaminate the water if the spring is created in a place where the water stands in a stagnant pool."

The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly. If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.\\n\\n\\nSafety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.\\nPeril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.\\nGreat Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour. If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.\\n\\n\\nChoosing which vision is \\\"correct\\\" takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face."

The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\\n\\n\\nA reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with a MP Pool has a 25% chance of losing all MP.\\n\\n\\nIt's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.\\n\\n\\nFor a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.\\n\\n\\nA creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.\\n\\n\\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nd%\\n\\n\\nIncarnation\\n\\n\\nStr\\n\\n\\nDex\\n\\n\\nCon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1-2\\n\\n\\nAegyl\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-4\\n\\n\\nAl Bhed\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5-6\\n\\n\\nAntica\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7-8\\n\\n\\nAu Ra\\n\\n\\n+2*\\n\\n\\n+2*\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9-10\\n\\n\\nBangaa\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11-12\\n\\n\\nBurmecian\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13-16\\n\\n\\nDwarf\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17-20\\n\\n\\nElvaan\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21-24\\n\\n\\nGalka\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25-26\\n\\n\\nGarlean\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n27-28\\n\\n\\nGenome\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29-30\\n\\n\\nGnath\\n\\n\\n-4\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n31-32\\n\\n\\nGoblin\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33-34\\n\\n\\nGria\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n35-36\\n\\n\\nGuado\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n37-40\\n\\n\\nHume\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n41-42\\n\\n\\nHypello\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n43-44\\n\\n\\nIxal\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45-46\\n\\n\\nKobold\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n47-48\\n\\n\\nKojin\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49-50\\n\\n\\nLamia\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n51-52\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n53-56\\n\\n\\nMithra\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n57-60\\n\\n\\nMoogle\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n61-62\\n\\n\\nNu Mou\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n63-64\\n\\n\\nOrc\\n\\n\\n+4\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n65-66\\n\\n\\nPalico\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+4\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n67-68\\n\\n\\nQiqirn\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n69-70\\n\\n\\nQu\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n71-72\\n\\n\\nQuadav\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n73-76\\n\\n\\nRoegadyn\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n77-79\\n\\n\\nRonso\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n80-81\\n\\n\\nSahagin\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n82-83\\n\\n\\nSeeq\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n84\\n\\n\\nShindroid\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n85-86\\n\\n\\nSylph\\n\\n\\n-4\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n87-90\\n\\n\\nTarutaru\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n91-92\\n\\n\\nTonkin\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n93-94\\n\\n\\nVanu Vanu\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n95-98\\n\\n\\nViera\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n99-100\\n\\n\\nYagudo\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n+2\\n\\n\\n-2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* For Au Ra, choose a subrace between Xaela and Raen.

        "description": "You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC. While the spell lasts, the target weapon's wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon's wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is discharged. If the weapon's wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the spell end, those ricochets are wasted."

A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from bludgeoning, earth, fire, ice, lightning, piercing, shadow, slashing, water, or wind.

Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell's casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell's DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target's limbs in front of or behind it. You can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together.\\n\\n\\nAs you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gil as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per dimensional anchor with a duration of 1 minute per caster level. If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gil as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints' hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can't be broken with a successful Strength check.

If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles.

The spell's exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast.\\n\\n\\nDesert: The spell transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly. The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra. Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis.\\n\\n\\nForest: Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).\\n\\n\\nHill: Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend.\\n\\n\\nMarsh: Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand.\\n\\n\\nMountain: The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche. Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.\\n\\n\\nPlain: Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).\\n\\n\\nUnderground: Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather, roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground. You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.\\n\\n\\nYou can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level illusionist could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to ice 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value."

If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree's height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20 hp per caster level you have).\\n\\n\\nEach building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed. Each cube within the fort is equivalent to a summon cottage, other than the size and its wooded construction material (hardness 5). When you cast sturdy tree fort, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. Designated creatures gain a +10 bonus on Climb checks and are not denied their Dexterity bonuses while climbing on the fort's structure, as they find handholds and stable footholds easily on the tree and its buildings.\\n\\n\\nYou cannot cast this spell in an area of worked stone, though you can cast it in natural surroundings that would not normally support the growth of a large tree, such as a cavern, desert, or glacier. If you cast this spell in a forest, jungle, or similar heavily treed terrain, the fort is camouflaged as long as its doors and windows remain closed (or even if they are open, as long as those within remain quiet and take no violent actions), requiring a successful DC 25 Perception check or Survival check to notice its presence."

The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise - it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).\\n\\n\\nThe door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with a lock (DC 30) and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. The cottage contains crude furnishings - eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk."

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \\\"walls\\\" and \\\"ceiling\\\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\\n\\n\\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\\n\\n\\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as plane shift. You are considered \\\"very familiar\\\" with your entire demiplane. You automatically leave this demiplane when the spell ends.\\n\\n\\nAs a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled.\\n\\n\\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two."

By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\\nStructure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on.

The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\\n\\n\\nYou can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. \\n\\n\\nSince the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. The entrance to the extradimensional space created by this spell does not move with any moving vehicle/airship."

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. Creatures summoned with this spell, or any higher variants, cannot have the Boss, Mini-Boss, Archfiend, or Primal subtypes.\\n\\n\\nThis spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. The full list of Summoned Creatures can be found here.\\n\\n\\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure, create, animate, or make another creature appear, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components, nor can they use any beneficial items that they come with on any creature but themselves.\\n\\n\\nCreatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \\\"*\\\" are summoned with the Divine template, if you are good, and the Unholy template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \\\"*\\\" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment.\\n\\n\\nSummon Limitations: Since summoned creatures can bog down combat encounters, as well as overwhelm due to numbers, GMs may feel the need to limit the amount of summon spells active at once. Ask your GM which of the following rules they follow, Single Limit is the default:\\n\\n\\n\\nSingle Limit: You can only have 1 summon spell active at any one time. Another casting of a summon spell will replace the previous creature/s\\nAbility Modifier Limit: You can only have summoned a number of creatures equal to your casting modifier. Any creature/s over the limit can replace previous creatures or won't be summoned.\\nNo Limits: You can summon as many creatures as you wish.\\n\\n\\n\\nSummon Monster II\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool summoning;

No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally. A resplendent mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as a summon mansion spell.\\n\\n\\nEach of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each alarm has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.\\n\\n\\nThe mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting all structural requirements for being built on, for example, a mountainside. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10% chance each day that the mansion begins to sink or collapse.\\n\\n\\nThe mansion doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and can't be created among a crowd or in a densely populated area.

        "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\\n\\n\\nUntil it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.\\n\\n\\nAs a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.\\n\\n\\nIn this case, \\\"reading\\\" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\\n\\n\\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.\\n\\n\\nWhen scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\\n\\n\\nYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\\n\\n\\nRead magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\\n\\n\\nA symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel targeted solely on the rune. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it."

An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.\\n\\n\\nAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\\n\\n\\nCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\\n\\n\\nViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\\n\\n\\nYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\\n\\n\\nCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\\n\\n\\nIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)."

Once you have used time regression, only you retain knowledge of what happened during the round that is being replayed; however, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to your companions, if desired. During the round that you live through a second time, you can act on knowledge you previously gained by already living through the immediate future. In all likelihood, you'll probably not choose to cast time regression during your second pass through the time stream, instead taking completely new actions. Altering the time stream in such a fashion is mentally taxing and you suffer 2 points of ability damage to Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom.

Interplanar travel is not possible, and the spell fails on any plane where time is meaningless. The character can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. Unwilling creatures cannot be affected by this spell. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.\\n\\n\\nTo cast this spell, the character must be able to state the arrival time accurately, down to the minute. The spell never transports the caster and companions to the precise minute desired, but it cannot function at all without a specific minute in time to target. This \\\"drift\\\" effect of not arriving at the precise time desired grows with the \\\"distance\\\" through time (measured in years, months, and weeks) traveled. Thus, a caster teleporting to last month arrives closer to her goal than one traveling 250 years. The minimum temporal distance traveled is 1 day, so this spell is not useful for going back to the beginning of a melee that is still progressing.\\n\\n\\nThis spell requires some knowledge of the destination time, so it cannot transport anyone into the future since the future is entirely unknown to the caster. Even spells that give knowledge of the future cannot give definite enough knowledge to allow this spell to work. It is possible to use this spell to travel forward in time, but only to the point in the caster's life when the caster first went back in time. Since the caster may not know exactly what is transpiring at the destination time, prudent time-travelers prepare for the worst. The errors in arrival for this spell occur in time rather than in location, since the character does not change locations at all. To see how closely the character arrives to the planned arrival time, consult this table:\\n\\n\\nTable: Time Walk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDistance Traveled (Temporal)Drift* ChanceMishap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 day to 1 month+/- d8 minutes5%\\n\\n\\n1 month to 1 year+/- d8 hours7%\\n\\n\\n1 year to 10 years+/- d20 hours10%\\n\\n\\n10 years to 100 years+/- d8 days15%\\n\\n\\n100 years to 1,000 years+/- d20 days20%\\n\\n\\n1,000 years ++/- d20 months25%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd or subtract the temporal drift to the destination time to determine the exact time of arrival. Mishaps result in the spell failing and the character taking 1 point of Intelligence damage for every 10 years of expected time travel due to the mental bombardment that time travel brings with it. Thus, a character trying to transport through 100 years would take 10 points of Intelligence damage. Intelligence can be reduced to 0 through this damage (but not lower).\\n\\n\\nIn the case that a traveler meets himself, the two travelers instantly lose control and attack each other with every ability and item at their disposal. However, should a traveler die while traveling in the past, the traveler's body immediately vanishes from the point of time it traveled to and returns to the point where the spell was cast at the time that the spell was cast. In other words, if a traveler perishes in a fire, the instant that the traveler died in that fire is the instant in which the traveler is no longer in that time period, and the body is never found within that location since it returns to the moment of time in which the traveler finished the spell and began time traveling.\\n\\n\\nThis spell cannot be crafted into scrolls or any other wondrous items and requires the caster to be a Time Mage of at least level 17."

If you cast this spell on a creature while another casting of touch of years is already in effect on it, the second spell doesn't deal ability drain. Instead, a failed initial Fortitude save renders the creature permanently deafened and blinded. These conditions can be removed by normal means (such as esuna), but doing this has no effect on the ability drain. This spell can't be dispelled, but any effect that would remove a curse allows the spellcaster a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to end the spell's duration.

He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\\n\\n\\nYou can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created can be horizontal or vertical, though if it is created horizontally the foundations must be strong enough to hold it, both horizontal and vertical creations must merge with existing stone. The size of the wall cannot exceed 1.5x the stone it originates from (a hand-sized rock cannot create a wall). This wall can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.\\n\\n\\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.\\n\\n\\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves."

        "description": "A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)\\n\\n\\nYou can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.\\n\\n\\nCreatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.\\n\\n\\nAny creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.\\n\\n\\nA wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes."

While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell's total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour.\\nSummer: The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target's base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour.\\nFall: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour.\\nWinter: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell's remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally."

        "description": "You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.\\n\\n\\nWhen you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of water damage (if the tsunami) or 6d6 points of earth damage (if the swell).\\n\\n\\nThe wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one geomancer class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion.\\n\\n\\nThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.\\n\\n\\nThe momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).\\n\\n\\nYou can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate."
